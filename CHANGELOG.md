---

## [2.1.0] - 2025-07-20
### Added
- Added benchmarks to README
- Added tutorials to README

### Changed
- Removed unused loop from valleys
- Inlined functions to improve runtime

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-07-03
### Added
- Expanded and improved documentation for core modules, including comprehensive doc comments and usage examples for `basic_indicators`, `candle_indicators`, `chart_trends`, and `correlation_indicators`.
- Additional inline documentation and usage instructions in the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files, clarifying usage philosophy and adding mascot introduction.
- New doc tests and panic handling for invalid period lengths and other edge cases in indicator functions.

### Changed
- Major refactor of argument signatures: Many functions (especially in `basic_indicators`, `chart_trends`, `correlation_indicators`) now take plain values (e.g., period: usize) instead of references (e.g., &usize).
- Improved error handling and panic messages across all indicator modules for consistency and clarity.
- Numerous functions now use iterators and more idiomatic Rust for windowed calculations and internal logic.
- Refined and clarified module-level and function-level documentation throughout the codebase.
- Refactored custom type handling to use more idiomatic Rust enums and structures.
- Updated tests across modules to cover new error handling and edge cases.

### Removed
- Deprecated legacy argument patterns (e.g., passing reference to period) across most modules for a cleaner API.
- Removed repetitive or redundant docstrings in favor of more centralized, clearer documentation
- Removed main and visa from examples to fall in line with diataxis, clearer tutorials and how tos will be put in another repo
