## New indicators
    * Go over Welles book to check the math from those that were done in PyTechnicalIndicators but also to add any others that are missing
    * Check other sources (such as investopedia, TI books...) for any other common indicators that may have been missed
    * Other types of correlation as well as normal with McGinley
