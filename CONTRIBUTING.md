## üõ†Ô∏è What to Work On?

- Remove `test_` prefix from all test functions
- Refactor parabolic T/P system: remove single functions; let bulk function determine trend (like `volatility` system)
- Allow indicators to use non-normal distributions (for variance, standard deviation, etc.)

### New Indicator Ideas

- Indicator showing price distribution over a period (count unique prices, order ascending)
- Median/mode absolute deviation based on deviation from mode/median (not mean)
- McGinley dynamic versions of indicators using MA (Donchian, Keltner, Supertrend, PPO, RVI, etc.)

## ‚ûï Adding a New Indicator

1. **Open an Issue**  
   - Describe the indicator, what it‚Äôs used for, and how it‚Äôs calculated (with source/reference)
2. **Implement the indicator**  
   - Add documentation and unit tests
3. **Verify results**  
   - Add a tab to `assets/rust_ti_hand_calcs.ods` with hand calculations to ensure test accuracy

## üß™ Code Style & Testing
