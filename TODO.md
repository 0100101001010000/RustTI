# TODO

## General
    * Add README once docs are in docs.rs
    * in both README and docs have an example with all indicators for S&P 
    * have examples for everything in lib.rs and why they would be used
    * Add all the docs that GH wants
    * remove test_ prefix from all tests
    * have standard indicators for indicator defaults
    * build lib and call it to see if it works

## Repo cleanup:
    * add branch protection rules
    

## New indicators
    * Go over Welles book to check the math from those that were done in PyTechnicalIndicators but also to add any others that are missing
    * Check other sources (such as investopedia, TI books...) for any other common indicators that may have been missed
    * Other types of correlation as well as normal with McGinley
