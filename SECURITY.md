# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest minor release of RustTI. Please update to the newest version before reporting security issues, as older releases may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in RustTI, **please do not disclose it publicly**.

Instead, report it privately and responsibly by:

- Opening a private GitHub security advisory:  
  [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/0100101001010000/RustTI/security/advisories/new)

Please include as much detail as possible to help us quickly resolve the issue.

We will respond as promptly as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure process with you. Thank you for helping keep RustTI and its users safe!
