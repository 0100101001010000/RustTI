# ü¶Ä Meet RusTI

Say hello to RusTI, the clawed crusader of candlesticks and the battle-hardened cousin of Ferris! ü¶Äüìà

Forged from rusted metal and born in the depths of the financial abyss, RusTI doesn't just ride sideways markets ‚Äî he lives for them. With a stack of notebooks, a thousand-yard stare, and more indicators on his screen than legs on his body, RusTI is the ultimate trading bro. He reads charts, calculates MACD in his sleep, and isn‚Äôt afraid to pinch your code into shape.

Welcome to RustTI ‚Äî powered by precision, performance, and one extremely serious crustacean.

# RustTI

A highly configurable and high-performance technical indicators library written in pure Rust. 

Designed for flexibility, speed, and advanced use cases in quantitative and algorithmic trading.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started (Tutorial)

> The fastest way to get up and running with RustTI.

**1. Add RustTI to your project:**

```shell
cargo add rust_ti
```
Or, manually in your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
rust_ti = "1.4.2"
```

**2. Calculate your first indicator:**

```rust
use rust_ti;

let prices = vec![100.2, 100.46, 100.53, 100.38, 100.19];

let ma = rust_ti::moving_average::single::moving_average(
    &prices,
    rust_ti::MovingAverageType::Simple
);
println!("Simple Moving Average: {}", ma);
```
Expected output:
```
Simple Moving Average: 100.352
```

## üìö Reference

> For complete API details, see [docs.rs/rust_ti](https://docs.rs/rust_ti/).

### Example

A reference of how to call each function can be found 

- [Reference Example](https://github.com/0100101001010000/RustTI/blob/main/examples/reference.rs)

Clone and run:
```shell
cargo build
cargo run --example reference
```


### Library Structure

- Modules based on their analysis areas (**`moving_average`**, **`momentum_indicators`**, **`strength_indicators`**...)
- **`bulk` & `single` submodules**  
  - `bulk`: Compute indicator over rolling periods, returns a vector.
  - `single`: Compute indicator for the entire vector, returns a single value.
- Types used to personalise the technical indicators (**`MovingAverageType`**, **`DeviationModel`**, **`Position`**...)

---

## üß† Explanation & Design

### Why RustTI?

- **Performance:** Pure Rust implementation for maximal speed, safety, and zero dependencies.
- **Configurability:** Most indicators are highly customizable‚Äîtweak calculation methods, periods, or even use medians instead of means.
- **Breadth:** Covers a wide range of technical indicators out of the box.
- **Advanced Use:** Designed for users who understand technical analysis and want deep control.

**Note:** Some features may require background in technical analysis. See [Investopedia: Technical Analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) for a primer.
